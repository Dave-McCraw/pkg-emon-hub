# OemGateway Configuration file example
# Copy this as oemgateway.conf (or any custom name) and edit settings

# Each listener and each buffer has 
# - a [[name]]: a unique string
# - a type: the name of the class it instantiates
# - a set of init_settings (depends on the type)
# - a set of runtime_settings (depends on the type)
# Both init_settings and runtime_settings sections must be defined, 
# even if empty. Init settings are used at initialization, and runtime
# settings are refreshed on a regular basis.

# All lines beginning with a '#' are comments and can be safely removed.
